                I love it. I didnt take it today on purpose to see if I would notice a difference and i have felt meh all afternoon. I've got hubby onto it too and he's noticed a difference in his sleep and energy mainly. He also said he noticed a difference in muscle recovery after the gym.

                I'm on day two and already feeling improvements. Finding it easier to wake up in the morning and lasting longer through the day!
